# Project Title: IoT Based Safety Kit for Construction Workers

## Description
This project aims to enhance the safety of construction workers through an IoT-based system. It involves monitoring various health and environmental parameters using a series of sensors and communicating the data to a central server for real-time monitoring and emergency response.

## Repository Contents
- `client_code.ino`: Contains the client-side code for reading sensor data and sending it to the server.
- `server_code.ino`: Server-side code that receives data from the client and stores it in Firebase.
- Additional sensor module codes: Separate files for each sensor module (details will be listed).

## Setup and Installation
1. **Hardware Setup**: List of required hardware components and connection instructions.
2. **Software Setup**: Instructions to set up the development environment and required libraries.
3. **Network Configuration**: Steps to configure network settings, Firebase setup, and other connectivity options.

## Running the Project
- Steps to compile and upload the client-side code to the microcontroller.
- Instructions for setting up and running the server-side application.
